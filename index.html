									<h2><a href="https://github.com/Julie-ally/Flex-Trade.">FLEX TRADE ONLINE SHOPPING APP.</a></h2>
									<p>FlexTrade is a well-known company in the online shopping world.Their app is designed to be easy to use, hoping to make shopping fun and simple for everyone. 
										Even though lots of people download and use the FlexTrade app, not everyone ends up buying something and FlexTrade wants to keep improving their app to make sure they stay ahead in the competitive online shopping market. I discovered through the analysis and visualization that many users leave the app quickly without buying anything and that users put items in their cart but don't complete the purchase. I created a dashboard using excel to look at how users behave and what they say to find out what needs to be better. 
										Through the suggestion I gave, it helped the company to reduce bounce rate and increase conversion rate by 20%.</p>

									<p>City Hospital is a well-respected institution in its community. 
										However, the leadership team recognized a growing need to leverage data for better decision making. 
										City Hospital lacked a centralized view of their financial performance. This made it difficult to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven decisions. 
										I used Power Bi tool for this project and I took the following steps: Data cleaning and Integration, Data Modelling, Dax Calculations and Dashboard Cleaning, then finally gave insights and reccomendations.</p>

									<p>BrightFuture Academy is a leading educational platform known for its academic excellence in technology. 
										The academy offers a variety of programs across multiple departments, providing students with high-quality education that prepares them for careers in technology and data. Despite its success, BrightFuture Academy faces several challenges that require a detailed analysis of its academic and operational data. 
										They had recently moved their data to a database and needed a data analyst to extract and manipulate their data. Using SQL, I was able to improve student success by identifying patterns in academic performance. 
										I helped the institution make informed decisions about course distribution across departments and also foster a culture of continuous improvement by providing actionable insights to both teachers and administrators.</p>
